due to GitHub restrictions of not uploading more than 100 files at once, and 'node_modules' contains, hundreds of files, so inorder to get node_modules, Please, run this -> ```npm install``` command, in the terminal of root directory of the project, to install node modules required by the project.

This would create a new folder 'node_modules' in the root directory of the project.
